# SPAM SMS DETECTION
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning model for detecting spam SMS messages. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) SMS messages.

The objective of this project is to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The notebook walks through the entire process:
- Loading and preprocessing the data
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction (using methods like Bag of Words or TF-IDF)
- Training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes)
- Evaluating the model's performance

## Dataset
The dataset used is a collection of SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham". It is publicly available and commonly used for spam detection tasks.

## Model Details
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming messages into a suitable format for machine learning.
- **Feature Extraction:** Using Bag of Words or TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Classification Model:** Typically a Naive Bayes classifier, which is effective for text classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

## Results
The notebook provides detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations to help understand model performance.  
You can experiment with different models and parameters to improve accuracy.
